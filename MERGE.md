   - **Chat:** https://the-ai-engineer-challenge-xi-khaki.vercel.app/chat
   ```

4. **Review and create the PR**

### Step 2: Merge the Pull Request

1. **Review the changes** in the GitHub interface
2. **Click "Merge pull request"**
3. **Choose merge type:**
   - **"Create a merge commit"** (recommended for feature branches)
   - **"Squash and merge"** (if you want to combine all commits)
   - **"Rebase and merge"** (if you want a linear history)

4. **Confirm the merge**

### Step 3: Clean Up

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull the latest changes
git pull origin main

# Delete the feature branch locally
git branch -d s03-assignment

# Delete the feature branch on GitHub (optional)
git push origin --delete s03-assignment
```

---

## 💻 Method 2: GitHub CLI (Command Line)

### Prerequisites
Install GitHub CLI if not already installed:
```bash
# macOS
brew install gh

# Or download from: https://cli.github.com/
```

### Step 1: Authenticate with GitHub
```bash
gh auth login
# Follow the prompts to authenticate
```

### Step 2: Create Pull Request via CLI
```bash
# Create PR from current branch to main
gh pr create --title "🎉 AI Engineer Challenge - Complete RAG Implementation" \
  --body "## 🚀 Features Added
- ✅ Complete RAG system with PDF upload
- ✅ Orange-styled API key input for better visibility  
- ✅ Dark/Light mode toggle
- ✅ Document-based Q&A functionality
- ✅ Unicode support for international characters
- ✅ Responsive UI with modern design

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **Chat:** https://the-ai-engineer-challenge-xi-khaki.vercel.app/chat" \
  --base main \
  --head s03-assignment
```

### Step 3: Review and Merge via CLI
```bash
# View the created PR
gh pr view

# Merge the PR (creates a merge commit)
gh pr merge --merge

# Or merge with squash (combines all commits)
gh pr merge --squash

# Or merge with rebase (linear history)
gh pr merge --rebase
```

### Step 4: Clean Up
```bash
# Switch to main and pull changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Delete local branch
git branch -d s03-assignment

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete s03-assignment
```

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After merging, verify everything works:

### 1. Check Main Branch
```bash
git checkout main
git log --oneline -5  # Should show your merge commit
```

### 2. Test Local Application
```bash
# Start backend
cd api && python app.py

# Start frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### 3. Verify Vercel Deployment
- Check that Vercel auto-deploys from main branch
- Test the live application
- Verify all features work

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If PR Creation Fails:
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# Ensure all changes are pushed
git push origin s03-assignment

# Check GitHub CLI authentication
gh auth status
```

### If Merge Conflicts Occur:
```bash
# Fetch latest main
git fetch origin main

# Merge main into your branch
git merge origin/main

# Resolve conflicts manually
# Then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "resolve: Fix merge conflicts"
git push origin s03-assignment
```

### If Vercel Doesn't Auto-Deploy:
1. Check Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure main branch is connected
3. Manually trigger deployment if needed
